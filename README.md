# DSOps-GHG-Calculator App

Welcome to the GHG Calculator App! This application provides a user-friendly platform to estimate carbon emissions for buildings based on factors like floor size, air conditioning parameters, and location. Our goal is to empower users with actionable insights to make environmentally conscious decisions, contributing to a more sustainable future.

## Introduction
As a group of data science students with a passion for sustainability, we created this app to help building owners, architects, and policymakers understand and reduce their buildings' carbon emissions. This app estimates emissions based on building characteristics, enabling users to identify key areas for energy efficiency improvements.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily input building data and view emissions estimates.
- **Accurate Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimations**: Algorithm-based estimation using factors such as floor size, air conditioning specifications, and geographic location.
- **Insights for Action**: View emission estimates and get actionable insights for potential reductions.
- **Supports Sustainable Decision-Making**: Ideal for building owners, architects, and policymakers.

## How It Works
Our algorithm calculates carbon emissions based on:
1. **Floor Size**: Larger areas typically require more energy for heating, cooling, and lighting.
2. **Air Conditioning Parameters**: The type, capacity, and usage patterns of air conditioning systems significantly affect energy consumption.
3. **Location**: Geographic factors influence greenhouse gas emission from building users' daily commute to work.

These inputs are processed to estimate the carbon footprint, allowing users to see potential areas for energy efficiency improvements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Git

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GAN-NINGCHANG/DSops-GHG-Caculator.git
   
2. **Install Required Packages**:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Application**:
streamlit run main.py

## Usage
1. **Open the app in your browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).**
2. **Enter the required information about the building, such as floor size, air conditioning details, location, and home addresses of empolyees if available.**
3. **View the estimated GHG emissions and suggested improvements.**

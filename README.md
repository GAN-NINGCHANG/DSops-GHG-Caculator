## Introduction
As a group of data science students with a passion for sustainability, we created this app to help building owners, architects, and policymakers understand and reduce their buildings' Greenhouse Gas emissions. This app estimates emissions based on building characteristics, enabling users to identify key areas for energy efficiency improvements.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily input building data and view emissions estimates.
- **Accurate Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimations**: Algorithm-based estimation using factors such as floor size, number of employee working in the building, and geographic location.
- **Insights for Action**: View emission estimates and get actionable insights for potential reductions.
- **Supports Sustainable Decision-Making**: Ideal for building owners, architects, and policymakers.

## How It Works
The GHG Emission Calculator operates through a streamlined, three-step process:

1. Data Input
   
  Users Provide basic building information, which are critical for accurate emissions calculation.

2. Processing and Analysis
   
  Our model processes the data, applying machine learning techniques and historical data trends to calculate a reliable estimate of GHG emissions.

3. Results and Emissions Breakdown
   
  View your buildingâ€™s estimated carbon footprint, segmented by sources. Get insights to make improvements.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Git

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GAN-NINGCHANG/DSops-GHG-Caculator.git
   
2. **Install Required Packages**:
